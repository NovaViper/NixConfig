#+title: Installation

1. Download the repo onto an live image copy of NixOS
2. Open the terminal and enter the repo directory
3. Run =nix-shell= to enter environment with all necessary packages to build the config properly
4. Follow the instructions over in the [[file:partitioning.org][Partitioning]] file!
5. Run =nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config --root /mnt= to create a base configuration file that the installer provides and see what are the ids for the newly created partitions.
   - This also shows what kernel modules are necessary for the device
6. Add the partition ids as exactly as they appear inside the =./hardware-configuration= file for the host; as well as any additional kernel modules
7. Change the =FLAKE= variable located under =./home/USERNAME/global/default.nix=, some dotfiles are sym-links and not having repo in the location will cause them to not work (which can break some apps)
8. Run =nixos-install --flake .#HOSTNAME --root /mnt= to install NixOS with the configuration
9. Move repo into the folder located on /mnt that matches your =FLAKE= environment variable
10. Restart and the system will boot up into NixOS!
